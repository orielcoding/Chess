# Chess
chess project

This branch is not a working chess game. It is just a stale documentation  for the previous is_revealing_king method, which checks check by vectoring from the king 
to the enemy's piece, and then checks weather enemy's piece can reach the king (depending on its movement type and restrictions of distance).
I saved this version, since it supposed to be less complex computationaly rather then check all enemy's piece validation towards the king. 

 # I'M NOT SURE WHETHER IT IS ACTUALLY MORE EFFICIENT. IT IS SAVED IN ORDER TO CONSIDER THIS OPTION IN FUTURE FOR OPTIONAL AI PROJECT.
